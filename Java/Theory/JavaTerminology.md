# Java Terminology

## JVM

=> The JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.
=> A programs execution is divided into three stages. A java program is written , compiled and then run.

=> As we can see in the image, first the JVM language classes are processed by the class loader subsystem which is
responsible for loading , linking and initialization
of the java classes. After being processed by the class loader, the generated files are stored in the JVM memory which
is consists of method area, heap, JVM language
stacks, PC registers and native method stacks. The execution engine accesses the files from the JVM memory makes use of
the native method interface and Native method libraries.

* A Java programmer creates a program
* The Javac compiler , which is primary Java compiler provided in the Java development kit(JDK), is used to compile the
  code. It accepts a Java application as input and outputs bytecode.
* JVM runs the bytecode generated by the compiler during the program's execution phase

=> The Java Virtual Machine's job is to run the bytecode generated by the compiler. Although each operating system has
its own JVM , the output they provide after bytecode execution
is consistent across all of them. Java is known as a platform-independent language for this reason.

## Bytecode

=> Bytecode is a type of intermediate code generated by the compiler after source code has been compiled (JAVA Program).
Java is a platform independent language thanks to this intermediate code.

## JRE

=> The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is included with the JDK.
=> The JRE installation on our computers allows us to run the Java Program , but we can not compile it. A browser ,JVM
applet , and plugins are all included in JRE. JRE is required for
a computer to run a JAVA program.
