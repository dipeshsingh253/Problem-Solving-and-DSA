# Problem-Solving-and-DSA
I love to study Data Structure and Algorithms. I push coding question that I have solved on different coding platforms.


# Note : First learn data structures following a proper roadmap and then go for Algorithms.
Even though we read both words together Data Structures and Algorithms still they both are not same you will have to prepare for them separately.

# Topics completed :

## DS :

- String
- List
- Array
- LinkedList
- Stack and Queue
- Tree
- BST

## Algo :

- sorting
- searching

## NOTE : I have alredy completed data structues and algo in java lang but now as a good developer we should understand how these ds works generally for any language. For that follow below resources.
